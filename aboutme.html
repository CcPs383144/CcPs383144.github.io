    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working towards being an in college and passing to be a scientist in astronomy. What led me here was when I was little I used to look into the stars and imagine how big they are and how far away they are from Earth. It was very interesting to me and I've always loved planets themselves especially Saturn with its beautiful rings. 

I'm working towards these goals by learning more about space and science. I'm learning everything about space by NASA articles that they put out. I look at all the new planets they discover. For example, there is a planet in a different galaxy that there is a planet that is just like earth. The difference is that its 50% larger than earth and the gravity is 2xs more than earth.

The values you need for my goals are you need to be really good at math, reading, science, and teamwork. I have 3 of those values I have math, a little bit of reading, and I'm great at teamwork. I need to get better at space science. That is why it is important for me to read those NASA articles.

Some short term goals I want to accomplish are passing school and getting into a college. I want to also improve my math, reading, and space science skill a bit more. I want to succeed in school.

The character traits i want to be known for are very good at communicating, very good at working with a team, and having a positive attribute in my community. I also want to be known for discovering a new planet or galaxy.</p>
